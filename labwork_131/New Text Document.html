		<p><b>London</b> is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom.</p>
		<p><b>London's</b> ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries.</p>
		<p>Since at least the 19th century, "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, 
		historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, 
		a region governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.</p>
